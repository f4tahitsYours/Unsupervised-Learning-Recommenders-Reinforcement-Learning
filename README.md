Welcome to the repository for the programming assignments from the course "Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning" offered by Stanford University and Deeplearning.AI. This README provides an overview of the programming assignments for each week of the course.

### Week 1: Unsupervised Learning
- **Practice Lab 1: k-means**
  - **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: k-means
  - **Description:** Implement the k-means clustering algorithm to partition data into k clusters. Understand how to initialize centroids, assign data points to clusters, and update centroids iteratively.
- **Practice Lab 2: Anomaly Detection**
  - **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Anomaly Detection
  - **Description:** Implement anomaly detection techniques to identify outliers or anomalies in data. Explore methods such as Gaussian distribution modeling and threshold-based anomaly detection.

### Week 2: Recommender Systems
- **Practice Lab 1: Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems**
  - **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems
  - **Description:** Implement collaborative filtering techniques to build recommender systems. Learn about user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches and how to compute similarities between users or items.
- **Practice Lab 2: Deep Learning for Content-Based Filtering**
  - **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Deep Learning for Content-Based Filtering
  - **Description:** Implement content-based filtering techniques using deep learning models. Learn how to represent items and users using embeddings and design neural networks for content-based recommendation.

### Week 3: Reinforcement Learning
- **Programming Assignment: Reinforcement Learning**
  - **Assignment:** Programming Assignment: Reinforcement Learning
  - **Description:** Implement reinforcement learning algorithms to solve sequential decision-making problems. Learn about Markov decision processes (MDPs), policy evaluation, policy improvement, and Q-learning.
